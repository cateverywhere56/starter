summary: "Ten-year data from the NOTION trial—the longest-running clinical trial to date to compare outcomes among low-risk patients randomised to undergo either transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) or surgical valve replacement (SAVR) for aortic stenosis—have shown that patients undergoing TAVI had a similar risk of all-cause mortality, stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) as those treated surgically.
