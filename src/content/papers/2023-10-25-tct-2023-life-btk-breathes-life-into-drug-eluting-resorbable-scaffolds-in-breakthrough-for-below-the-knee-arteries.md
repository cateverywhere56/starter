summary: "Results of the LIFE-BTK randomised controlled trial have just been presented at TCT 2023 (23–26 October, San Francisco, USA). The data show that, in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI) due to infrapopliteal artery disease, an everolimus-eluting resorbable scaffold was superior to angioplasty at one year with respect to the primary efficacy endpoint."

## L’essentiel

Results of the LIFE-BTK randomised controlled trial have just been presented at TCT 2023 (23–26 October, San Francisco, USA). The data show that, in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI) due to infrapopliteal artery disease, an everolimus-eluting resorbable scaffold was superior to angioplasty at one year with respect to the primary efficacy endpoint.
