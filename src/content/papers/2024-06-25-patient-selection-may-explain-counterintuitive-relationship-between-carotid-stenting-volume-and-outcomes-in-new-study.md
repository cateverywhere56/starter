summary: "High stroke and death rates relating to carotid stenting in the Pacific Northwest may be driven by the selection of high-risk patients with less than 80% stenosis, and reducing the frequency of stenting in this high-risk group—along with better adherence to guideline-recommended medical management—could improve regional outcomes.
