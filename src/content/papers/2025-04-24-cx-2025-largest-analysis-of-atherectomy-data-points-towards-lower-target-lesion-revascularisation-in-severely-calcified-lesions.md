publishedDate: "24 avril 2025"
summary: "In the largest systematic review and meta-analysis of atherectomy data to date, Thomas Zeller (Bad Krozingen, Germany) reported that the technique is effective in both calcified and non-calcified lesions but observed a trend toward lower target-lesion revascularisation (TLR) in severely calcified lesions. He reported that major amputation and mortality rates were low in above-the-knee lesions [&#8230;] The post CX 2025: Largest analysis of atherectomy data points towards lower target-lesion revascularisation in severely calcified lesions appeared first on Vascular News ."

## L’essentiel

In the largest systematic review and meta-analysis of atherectomy data to date, Thomas Zeller (Bad Krozingen, Germany) reported that the technique is effective in both calcified and non-calcified lesions but observed a trend toward lower target-lesion revascularisation (TLR) in severely calcified lesions. He reported that major amputation and mortality rates were low in above-the-knee lesions [&#8230;] The post CX 2025: Largest analysis of atherectomy data points towards lower target-lesion revascularisation in severely calcified lesions appeared first on Vascular News .
