publishedDate: "3 avril 2025"
summary: "Low-dose colchicine (0.5mg per day) significantly reduced the total plaque volume progression by 1.1% among patients with stable coronary artery disease compared to placebo, but failed to significantly reduce low attenuation plaque. These are findings of the EKSTROM trial, presented during a late-breaking trial session at the 2025 American College of Cardiology (ACC) scientific session [&#8230;] The post ACC.25: Low-dose colchicine seen to reduce coronary plaque progression in EKSTROM trial appeared first on Cardiovascular News ."

## L’essentiel

Low-dose colchicine (0.5mg per day) significantly reduced the total plaque volume progression by 1.1% among patients with stable coronary artery disease compared to placebo, but failed to significantly reduce low attenuation plaque. These are findings of the EKSTROM trial, presented during a late-breaking trial session at the 2025 American College of Cardiology (ACC) scientific session [&#8230;] The post ACC.25: Low-dose colchicine seen to reduce coronary plaque progression in EKSTROM trial appeared first on Cardiovascular News .
