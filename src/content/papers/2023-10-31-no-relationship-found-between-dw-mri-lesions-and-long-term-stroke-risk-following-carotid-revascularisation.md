summary: "A secondary analysis of existing clinical trial data has indicated that new ischaemic brain lesions detected via diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) following carotid artery revascularisation—either with carotid artery stenting (CAS) or carotid endarterectomy (CEA)—do not appear to have a relationship with long-term stroke risks. “The results from our analysis do not support the role [&#8230;] The post No relationship found between DW-MRI lesions and long-term stroke risk following carotid revascularisation appeared first on Vascular News ."
