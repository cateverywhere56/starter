summary: "The use of mechanical thrombectomy, specifically computer-assisted vacuum thrombectomy (CAVT) using the 16Fr Lightning Flash system (Penumbra), with anticoagulation achieves superior reduction in right heart strain compared to anticoagulation therapy alone in patients with acute intermediate-high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE).
