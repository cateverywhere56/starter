summary: "A recent prospective, multicentre cohort study provides insights into early and late aortic-related mortality and rupture after fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair (F/BEVAR) of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs). Researchers claim these are likely to represent the most comprehensive data on the topic for the foreseeable future, citing the unworkable nature of a randomised study."

## L’essentiel

A recent prospective, multicentre cohort study provides insights into early and late aortic-related mortality and rupture after fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair (F/BEVAR) of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs). Researchers claim these are likely to represent the most comprehensive data on the topic for the foreseeable future, citing the unworkable nature of a randomised study.
