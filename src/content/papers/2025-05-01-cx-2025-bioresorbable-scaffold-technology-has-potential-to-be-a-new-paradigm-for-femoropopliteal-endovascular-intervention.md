## L’essentiel

In Wednesday&#8217;s peripheral arterial programme, which hosted several podium-first presentations, lower limb drug-eluting technologies took centre stage—signalling a potential shift in the treatment paradigm for chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI). Investigators shared compelling new data from studies ranging from first-in-human trials to large-scale registries, which vie to redefine durability and safety, as well as cost-effectiveness, in [&#8230;] The post CX 2025: Bioresorbable scaffold technology has ‘potential to be a new paradigm for femoropopliteal endovascular intervention’ appeared first on Cardiovascular News .
