summary: "In patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) resulted in a lower one-year rate of the composite outcome of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or clinically driven revascularisation compared with angiography guidance alone.

## L’essentiel

In patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) resulted in a lower one-year rate of the composite outcome of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or clinically driven revascularisation compared with angiography guidance alone. This is the finding of a two-stage, multicentre, randomised trial—IVUS-ACS—published in The Lancet and presented [&#8230;] The post IVUS-guided PCI comes out on top over angiography in trial in acute coronary syndrome patients appeared first on Cardiovascular News .
