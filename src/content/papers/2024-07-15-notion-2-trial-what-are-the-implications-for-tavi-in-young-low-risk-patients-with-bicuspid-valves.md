summary: "Ole De Backer (Copenhagen, Denmark) unpacks the results of the NOTION-2 study, in which investigators compared transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in younger, low-risk patients. The trial is the first to randomise younger, low-risk patients with either tricuspid or bicuspid aortic stenosis to a transcatheter or surgical approach, and [&#8230;] The post NOTION-2 trial: What are the implications for TAVI in young, low-risk patients with bicuspid valves?"

Ole De Backer (Copenhagen, Denmark) unpacks the results of the NOTION-2 study, in which investigators compared transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in younger, low-risk patients. The trial is the first to randomise younger, low-risk patients with either tricuspid or bicuspid aortic stenosis to a transcatheter or surgical approach, and [&#8230;] The post NOTION-2 trial: What are the implications for TAVI in young, low-risk patients with bicuspid valves?
