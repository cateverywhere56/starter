publishedDate: "1 avril 2025"
summary: "Patients undergoing transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) using the Triclip (Abbott) system for the treatment of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) were less likely to be hospitalised for recurrent heart failure than patients treated only with medical therapy after two years of follow-up, latest results from the TRILUMINATE pivotal trial have shown.
