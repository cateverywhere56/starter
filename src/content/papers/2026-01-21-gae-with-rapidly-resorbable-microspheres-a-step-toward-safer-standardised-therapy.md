summary: "Genicular artery embolization (GAE) has emerged as a minimally invasive treatment option for patients with osteoarthritis-related knee pain unresponsive to conservative therapy. Here, Florian Nema Fleckenstein (Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany) describes how, by selectively occluding hypervascular synovial branches, the procedure targets chronic low-grade inflammation and aberrant neoinnervation, key drivers of osteoarthritis pain."

## L’essentiel

Genicular artery embolization (GAE) has emerged as a minimally invasive treatment option for patients with osteoarthritis-related knee pain unresponsive to conservative therapy. Here, Florian Nema Fleckenstein (Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany) describes how, by selectively occluding hypervascular synovial branches, the procedure targets chronic low-grade inflammation and aberrant neoinnervation, key drivers of osteoarthritis pain.
