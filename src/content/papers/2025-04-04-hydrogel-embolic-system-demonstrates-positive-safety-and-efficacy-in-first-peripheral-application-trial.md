summary: "Preliminary results from the prospective, randomised, multicentre Instylla Hydrogel Embolic System (HES; Instylla) trial show the liquid embolic met primary safety and effectiveness endpoints, with a 99% freedom from major adverse event rate at 30 days follow-up, compared to a literature-derived performance goal of 75%. The results of the trial were presented by Nadine Abi-Jaoudeh [&#8230;] The post Hydrogel embolic system demonstrates positive safety and efficacy in “first” peripheral application trial appeared first on Interventional News ."
