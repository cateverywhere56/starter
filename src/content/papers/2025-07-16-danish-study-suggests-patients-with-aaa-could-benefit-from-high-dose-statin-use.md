title: "Danish study suggests patients with AAA could benefit from high-dose statin use"

publishedDate: "16 juillet 2025"
summary: "A five-year prospective cohort study—using longitudinal registry data from two population-based screening trials—has found that high-dose statin use was associated with decreased abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) growth rates and lowered risk of undergoing repair, rupture, and death. Researchers therefore suggest high-dose statins should be “strongly considered” for patients with small AAAs."

## L’essentiel

A five-year prospective cohort study—using longitudinal registry data from two population-based screening trials—has found that high-dose statin use was associated with decreased abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) growth rates and lowered risk of undergoing repair, rupture, and death. Researchers therefore suggest high-dose statins should be “strongly considered” for patients with small AAAs.
