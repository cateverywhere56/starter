## L’essentiel

Staged total endovascular aortic repair (TEAR) utilising arch branched and thoracoabdominal fenestrated and branched endografts is effective, but identified predictors of morbidity and mortality—including stroke—highlight the importance of individualised risk assessment to optimise outcomes. These are some of the key findings of a study presented at the 2025 Vascular Annual Meeting (VAM; 4–7 June, New Orleans, [&#8230;] The post Transatlantic multicentre experience highlights effectiveness of total endovascular aortic repair with F/BEVAR but 5% risk of major stroke appeared first on Vascular News .
