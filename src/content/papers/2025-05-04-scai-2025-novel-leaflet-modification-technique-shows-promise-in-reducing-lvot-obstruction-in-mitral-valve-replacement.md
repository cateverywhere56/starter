summary: "A novel technique to reduce left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction during transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) has been shown to be safe and effective, and to result in shorter procedure times. This is according to new data from an international registry presented by Gennaro Giustino (Morristown Medical Center, Morristown, USA) at the 2025 Society [&#8230;] The post SCAI 2025: Novel leaflet modification technique shows promise in reducing LVOT obstruction in mitral valve replacement appeared first on Cardiovascular News ."

## L’essentiel

A novel technique to reduce left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction during transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) has been shown to be safe and effective, and to result in shorter procedure times. This is according to new data from an international registry presented by Gennaro Giustino (Morristown Medical Center, Morristown, USA) at the 2025 Society [&#8230;] The post SCAI 2025: Novel leaflet modification technique shows promise in reducing LVOT obstruction in mitral valve replacement appeared first on Cardiovascular News .
