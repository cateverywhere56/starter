summary: "Thirty-day results from the PERFORMANCE III study of integrated embolic protection (IEP) in transcarotid artery revascularisation (TCAR) demonstrate &#8220;very low&#8221; 30-day event rates. Sean Lyden (Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA) shared this finding during a late-breaking trials session at the 2025 Vascular Interventional Advances (VIVA) conference (2–5 November, Las Vegas, USA)."

## L’essentiel

Thirty-day results from the PERFORMANCE III study of integrated embolic protection (IEP) in transcarotid artery revascularisation (TCAR) demonstrate &#8220;very low&#8221; 30-day event rates. Sean Lyden (Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA) shared this finding during a late-breaking trials session at the 2025 Vascular Interventional Advances (VIVA) conference (2–5 November, Las Vegas, USA).
