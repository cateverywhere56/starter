summary: "The use of catheter-based localised delivery of drugs for treatment of cancer patients has proven to be effective and provides the benefit of reduced systemic toxicity. A critical prerequisite for these modalities is the angiographic identification and engagement of feeder vessels of appropriate size into the tumours in order to deliver the designated therapy."
