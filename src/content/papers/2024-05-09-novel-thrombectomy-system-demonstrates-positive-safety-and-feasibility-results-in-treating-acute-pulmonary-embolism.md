## L’essentiel

Late-breaking data from the ENGULF trial showed that a novel dual-action thrombectomy device was effective and safe in treating acute pulmonary embolism (PE). The safety and effectiveness results were presented today as late-breaking science at the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography &#38; Interventions (SCAI) 2024 Scientific Sessions and simultaneously published in JSCAI.
