summary: "A population-based cohort study of patients treated in the Austrian healthcare system has found that transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with a significantly increased rate of all-cause mortality than surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients over the age of 65 treated for severe aortic stenosis.

A population-based cohort study of patients treated in the Austrian healthcare system has found that transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with a significantly increased rate of all-cause mortality than surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients over the age of 65 treated for severe aortic stenosis.
