summary: "An artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced electrocardiography model may effectively predict the development and progression of moderate or severe mitral, tricuspid or aortic regurgitation—MR, TR, or AR—before the appearance of symptoms or physical changes that can be detected by ultrasound, research published in the European Heart Journal has shown. The study was led by Arunashis Sau and [&#8230;] The post AI model able to predict onset of valve regurgitation appeared first on Cardiovascular News ."
