summary: "Majorie van Helvert (University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands) and Michel Reijnen (Rijnstate Hospital, Arnhem, The Netherlands) are currently conducting research on ultrafast contrast-enhanced ultrasound blood flow quantification in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients after endovascular treatment. Early findings show that the new technique could offer an innovative imaging alternative."

## L’essentiel

Majorie van Helvert (University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands) and Michel Reijnen (Rijnstate Hospital, Arnhem, The Netherlands) are currently conducting research on ultrafast contrast-enhanced ultrasound blood flow quantification in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients after endovascular treatment. Early findings show that the new technique could offer an innovative imaging alternative.
