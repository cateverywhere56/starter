title: "New randomised data show cyanoacrylate glue performs strongly on patient satisfaction"

publishedDate: "1 mai 2024"
summary: "Patients undergoing cyanoacrylate glue closure for superficial venous disease reported higher periprocedural satisfaction than those who were treated via surgical stripping, data from a pair of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the VenaSeal system (Medtronic) reveal. The modality also showed greater improvement in disease-specific quality-of-life compared to surgery or endothermal ablation."

## L’essentiel

Patients undergoing cyanoacrylate glue closure for superficial venous disease reported higher periprocedural satisfaction than those who were treated via surgical stripping, data from a pair of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the VenaSeal system (Medtronic) reveal. The modality also showed greater improvement in disease-specific quality-of-life compared to surgery or endothermal ablation.
