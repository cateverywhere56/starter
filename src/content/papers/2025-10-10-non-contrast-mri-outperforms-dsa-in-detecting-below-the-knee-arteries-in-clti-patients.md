title: "Non-contrast MRI outperforms DSA in detecting below-the-knee arteries in CLTI patients"

publishedDate: "10 octobre 2025"
summary: "Researchers have shown that quiescent-inflow single-shot (QISS) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is able to identify more below-the-knee vessel segments than digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI). Taking first prize for best abstract, Alexander Crichton (Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, USA and University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK) shared this and other findings [&#8230;] The post Non-contrast MRI outperforms DSA in detecting below-the-knee arteries in CLTI patients appeared first on Vascular News ."
