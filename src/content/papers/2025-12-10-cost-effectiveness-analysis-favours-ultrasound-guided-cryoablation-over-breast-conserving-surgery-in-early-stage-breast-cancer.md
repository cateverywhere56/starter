## L’essentiel

A cost-effectiveness analysis comparing ultrasound-guided cryoablation and breast-conserving surgery for patients with early-stage, low-risk breast cancer has shown the former to provide comparable health benefit at a lower cost. Led by Xiao Wu (University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, USA), the research team constructed a Markov decision tree comparing cryoablation and surgery for small [&#8230;] The post Cost-effectiveness analysis favours ultrasound-guided cryoablation over breast-conserving surgery in early-stage breast cancer appeared first on Interventional News .
