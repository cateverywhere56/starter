summary: "An analysis involving some 300 patients with anterior-circulation acute ischaemic strokes caused by tandem lesions has determined a number of factors that may be predictive of good clinical outcomes at three months following an endovascular mechanical thrombectomy procedure. Said factors include admission glycaemia; initiating dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and statin therapy within 12 and 24 hours, [&#8230;] The post Early DAPT, statin therapy and stent patency among predictors of good post-thrombectomy outcomes appeared first on Interventional News ."
