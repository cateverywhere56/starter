publishedDate: "9 janvier 2025"
summary: "A retrospective study has indicated that carotid artery stenting (CAS)—when performed by fellowship‐trained neurointerventional physicians in comprehensive stroke centre (CSC) settings—was associated with a lower complication rate as compared to prior literature on CAS, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and transcarotid artery revascularisation (TCAR).
