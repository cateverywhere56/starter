## L’essentiel

Geneticure has announced that the US Patent and Trademark Office has granted a patent for a genetic-based weighted algorithm model for predicting response to renal denervation. This patent protects Geneticure’s proprietary method of using a patient’s genetic profile to predict their likelihood of benefiting from renal denervation—a minimally invasive procedure used to treat hypertension.
