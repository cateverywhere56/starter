## L’essentiel

Stereotaxis has announced a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory submission for the first robotically navigated catheter designed to expand usage of robotic magnetic navigation into the broader endovascular field. Emagin 5F is the first in a family of robotically navigated endovascular devices being developed by Stereotaxis.
