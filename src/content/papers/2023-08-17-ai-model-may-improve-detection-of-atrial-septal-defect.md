summary: "An artificial intelligence (AI) model may be more efficient at detecting signatures of atrial septal defect (ASD) in electrocardiograms (ECG) than traditional methods. This is according to investigators from Brigham and Women’s Hospital (Boston, USA) and Keio University (Tokyo, Japan), who have developed a deep learning AI model to screen ECG for signs of ASD."

## L’essentiel

An artificial intelligence (AI) model may be more efficient at detecting signatures of atrial septal defect (ASD) in electrocardiograms (ECG) than traditional methods. This is according to investigators from Brigham and Women’s Hospital (Boston, USA) and Keio University (Tokyo, Japan), who have developed a deep learning AI model to screen ECG for signs of ASD.
