## L’essentiel

Empagliflozin preserved kidney function and was safe to initiate in heart attack patients, findings of a secondary analysis of the EMPACT-MI trial, published in nature cardiovascular research have shown. EMPACT-MI is a multicentre, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled superiority trial investigating the effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin on all-cause mortality and hospitalisation due to heart [&#8230;] The post EMPACT-MI analysis “reassuring” on use of empagliflozin in patients with poor kidney function appeared first on Cardiovascular News .
