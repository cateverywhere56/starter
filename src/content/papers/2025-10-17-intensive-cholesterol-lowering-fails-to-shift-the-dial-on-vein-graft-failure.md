summary: "Intensive LDL cholesterol lowering with evolocumab does not reduce saphenous vein graft failure after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery compared to placebo, results of a randomised controlled trial have shown. This is the headline finding of NEWTON-CABG CardioLink-5, an investigator-initiated randomised, placebo-controlled trial, involving more than 700 patients from sites in Canada, Australia, Hungary [&#8230;] The post Intensive cholesterol lowering fails to shift the dial on vein graft failure appeared first on Cardiovascular News ."
