publishedDate: "26 janvier 2024"
summary: "The results of a propensity-matched analysis of all patients undergoing mitral valve surgery or transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) for severe mitral regurgitation, taken from France’s national administrative hospital discharge database, suggest that TEER was associated with lower cardiovascular mortality than mitral surgery at mid to long-term follow-up.
