summary: "Recent THRIVE study data show that Penumbra’s computer-assisted vacuum thrombectomy (CAVT) technology not only has the potential to improve outcomes for lower extremity acute limb ischaemia (LE-ALI) patients, but may also reduce healthcare resource use, thus potentially lowering overall costs for the healthcare system. The latest data were presented at the 2025 Vascular Annual Meeting [&#8230;] The post New THRIVE data on Penumbra’s CAVT technology for acute limb ischaemia presented at VAM 2025 appeared first on Vascular News ."
