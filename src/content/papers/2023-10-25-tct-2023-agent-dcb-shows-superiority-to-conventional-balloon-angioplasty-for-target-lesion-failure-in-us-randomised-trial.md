summary: "The first US randomised trial investigating the safety and efficacy on the use of a drug-coated balloon (DCB) for the treatment of coronary in-stent restenosis (ISR) has shown the superiority of the Agent (Boston Scientific) DCB compared to conventional balloon angioplasty for a primary endpoint of target lesion failure at one year.

## L’essentiel

The first US randomised trial investigating the safety and efficacy on the use of a drug-coated balloon (DCB) for the treatment of coronary in-stent restenosis (ISR) has shown the superiority of the Agent (Boston Scientific) DCB compared to conventional balloon angioplasty for a primary endpoint of target lesion failure at one year.
