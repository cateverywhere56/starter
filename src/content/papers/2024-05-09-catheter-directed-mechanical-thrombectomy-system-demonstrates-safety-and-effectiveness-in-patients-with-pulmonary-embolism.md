publishedDate: "9 mai 2024"
summary: "Results from Acute Pulmonary Embolism Extraction Trial with the AlphaVac System (APEX-AX) finds significant improvement in right ventricle function and minimal major adverse events. New data from APEX-AV demonstrated that catheter-directed mechanical thrombectomy is safe and effective in patients with acute intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) with significant improvement in the right ventricle (RV) function and [&#8230;] The post Catheter-directed mechanical thrombectomy system demonstrates safety and effectiveness in patients with pulmonary embolism appeared first on Interventional News ."
