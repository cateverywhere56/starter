publishedDate: "6 juin 2024"
summary: "Analysis of data from the TVT registry, looking at the impact of cerebral embolic protection devices on disabling stroke after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), demonstrates a “small, borderline significant” reduction in in-hospital disabling stroke, with patients with prior stroke the most likely to benefit from the use of embolic protection devices.
