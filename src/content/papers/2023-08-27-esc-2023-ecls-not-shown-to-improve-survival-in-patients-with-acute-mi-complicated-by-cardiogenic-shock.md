summary: "Early extracorporeal life support (ECLS) does not improve survival in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) complicated by cardiogenic shock who are scheduled for early revascularisation. This was the headline finding from the ECLS-SHOCK trial, presented during a Hot Line session at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) congress (25–28 August, Amsterdam, The Netherlands)."

## L’essentiel

Early extracorporeal life support (ECLS) does not improve survival in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) complicated by cardiogenic shock who are scheduled for early revascularisation. This was the headline finding from the ECLS-SHOCK trial, presented during a Hot Line session at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) congress (25–28 August, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).
