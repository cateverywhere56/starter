## L’essentiel

New data suggest that interventionalists can safely opt to defer the treatment of non-culprit lesions when addressing ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and multivessel coronary artery disease. This is the finding at three years of a trial of two revascularisation strategies for STEMI in patients with multivessel disease, in which instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR)-guided revascularisation [&#8230;] The post TCT 2025: Deferring treatment of non-culprit lesions “remains an option” for STEMI in multivessel disease appeared first on Cardiovascular News .
