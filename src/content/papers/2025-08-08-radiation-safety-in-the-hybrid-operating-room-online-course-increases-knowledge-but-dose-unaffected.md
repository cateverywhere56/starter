summary: "The implementation of a massive open online course (MOOC) has been shown to increase radiation safety behaviour in the hybrid operating room and decrease fluoroscopy time. This and other findings—including uncertainty around the course’s ability to reduce radiation dose—were recently published online as a research letter in the European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery [&#8230;] The post Radiation safety in the hybrid operating room: Online course increases knowledge but dose unaffected appeared first on Vascular News ."

## L’essentiel

The implementation of a massive open online course (MOOC) has been shown to increase radiation safety behaviour in the hybrid operating room and decrease fluoroscopy time. This and other findings—including uncertainty around the course’s ability to reduce radiation dose—were recently published online as a research letter in the European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery [&#8230;] The post Radiation safety in the hybrid operating room: Online course increases knowledge but dose unaffected appeared first on Vascular News .
