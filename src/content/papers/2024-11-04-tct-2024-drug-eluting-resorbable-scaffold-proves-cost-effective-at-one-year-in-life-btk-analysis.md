## L’essentiel

A retrospective economic analysis of the LIFE-BTK trial has demonstrated the one-year cost-effectiveness of an everolimus-eluting resorbable scaffold over angioplasty for the treatment of infrapopliteal artery disease, with investigators predicting more significant results in the longer term. Sharing this finding at TCT 2024 (27–30 October, Washington, DC, USA), LIFE-BTK co-principal investigator Sahil Parikh (Columbia University [&#8230;] The post TCT 2024: Drug-eluting resorbable scaffold proves cost effective at one year in LIFE-BTK analysis appeared first on Cardiovascular News .
