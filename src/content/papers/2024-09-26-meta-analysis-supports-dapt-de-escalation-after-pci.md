## L’essentiel

De-escalation to ticagrelor monotherapy does not increase ischaemic risk and reduces the risk of major bleeding when compared to 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), particularly among patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). This was the finding of a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD)-level meta-analysis of randomised [&#8230;] The post Meta-analysis supports DAPT de-escalation after PCI appeared first on Cardiovascular News .
