Using proprietary shape-memory biocompatible polymers, Embolization&#8217;s coil devices achieve better vascular occlusion while minimising artifacts in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance [&#8230;] The post Embolization receives US FDA 510(k) clearance for its NED embolisation device appeared first on Vascular News ."
