## L’essentiel

A recently published retrospective study has shown that a deep learning model based on non-contrast computed tomography (CT) can detect endoleak after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) “with high sensitivity”. Writing in CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology (CVIR), Qingqi Yang, Jinglang Hu (both Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China) and colleagues share that their study involved 245 patients [&#8230;] The post Use of AI in endoleak detection deemed “feasible” with “potentially significant” implications for patients and health systems appeared first on Vascular News .
