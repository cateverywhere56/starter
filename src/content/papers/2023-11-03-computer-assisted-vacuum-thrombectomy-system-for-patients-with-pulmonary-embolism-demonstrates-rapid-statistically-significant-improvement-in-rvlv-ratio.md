summary: "Patients undergoing computer-assisted vacuum thrombectomy with the Indigo Aspiration System (Penumbra) for pulmonary embolism (PE) showed 2.7% rates of both major adverse events (MAEs) and major bleeding at 48 hours post-procedure alongside “a significant reduction” in right ventricle/left ventricle (RV/LV) ratio of 25.7%, according to an interim analysis of the STRIKE-PE study. “The STRIKE-PE dataset [&#8230;] The post Computer-assisted vacuum thrombectomy system for patients with pulmonary embolism demonstrates ‘rapid, statistically significant’ improvement in RV/LV ratio appeared first on Vascular News ."
