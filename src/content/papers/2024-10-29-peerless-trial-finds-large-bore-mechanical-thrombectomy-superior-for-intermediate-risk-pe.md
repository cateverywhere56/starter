summary: "Findings from the first international randomised controlled trial (RCT) to compare patient outcomes following treatment with large-bore mechanical thrombectomy (LBMT) versus catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) for intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) found that LBMT is superior with respect to the hierarchically-tested aggregated outcome of all-cause mortality, intracranial haemorrhage, major bleeding, clinical deterioration and/or escalation to bailout therapy, [&#8230;] The post PEERLESS trial finds large-bore mechanical thrombectomy superior for intermediate-risk PE appeared first on Interventional News ."
