## L’essentiel

New data from a prospective, multicentre randomised controlled trial show similar hepatic progression-free survival (hPFS) using bland transarterial embolization (TAE) or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) when treating neuroendocrine tumour metastases in the liver. Michael Soulen (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA) presented these findings at the Society of Interventional Oncology (SIO) annual scientific meeting (30 January—3 February, [&#8230;] The post First release RETNET data show no difference in progression-free survival between TAE and TACE for neuroendocrine liver tumours appeared first on Interventional News .
