summary: "Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the first-in-human study of the DurAVR transcatheter heart valve (THV, Anteris Technologies), shared at New York Valves (5–7 June, New York, USA), demonstrate that the valve was able to restore normal flow and haemodynamics, leading to significant left ventricular mass regression in patients with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis. [&#8230;] The post Cardiac-MRI data from DurAVR FIH study shared at New York Valves appeared first on Cardiovascular News ."

## L’essentiel

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the first-in-human study of the DurAVR transcatheter heart valve (THV, Anteris Technologies), shared at New York Valves (5–7 June, New York, USA), demonstrate that the valve was able to restore normal flow and haemodynamics, leading to significant left ventricular mass regression in patients with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis.
