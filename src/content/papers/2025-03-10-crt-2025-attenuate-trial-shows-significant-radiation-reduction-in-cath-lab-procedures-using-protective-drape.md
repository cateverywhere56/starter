## L’essentiel

A large single-centre randomised trial has shown that the use of a protective scatter radiation absorbing shield significantly reduces proximal operator radiation exposure for during contemporary cath lab procedures, including coronary and structural interventions. Results of the ATTENUATE trial—assessing the use of the Radpad Orange (Worldwide Innovations &#38; Technologies) antimony and bismuth drape peripheral shield—were presented [&#8230;] The post CRT 2025: ATTENUATE trial shows significant radiation reduction in cath lab procedures using protective drape appeared first on Cardiovascular News .
