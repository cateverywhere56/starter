summary: "New two-year follow-up data from the BIOMAG-I first-in-human trial confirms a reliable and predictable long-term safety profile for Freesolve, the third-generation resorbable magnesium scaffold (RMS), establishing it as a true alternative to contemporary drug-eluting stents (DES). The results were presented by Michael Haude (Rheinland Klinikum, Neuss, Germany) at the 2024 EuroPCR conference (14–17 May, Paris, France)."

## L’essentiel

New two-year follow-up data from the BIOMAG-I first-in-human trial confirms a reliable and predictable long-term safety profile for Freesolve, the third-generation resorbable magnesium scaffold (RMS), establishing it as a true alternative to contemporary drug-eluting stents (DES).
