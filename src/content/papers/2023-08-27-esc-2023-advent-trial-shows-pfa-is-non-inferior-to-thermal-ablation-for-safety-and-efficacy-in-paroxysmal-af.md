summary: "Results of the first randomised trial comparing pulsed field ablation (PFA) to thermal ablation for the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF)—ADVENT—have shown that PFA is as safe and effective at 12 months. Findings of the study, which involves Boston Scientific’s Farapulse PFA system, were presented by principal investigator Vivek Reddy (Icahn School of Medicine, [&#8230;] The post ESC 2023: ADVENT trial shows PFA is non-inferior to thermal ablation for safety and efficacy in paroxysmal AF appeared first on Cardiovascular News ."
