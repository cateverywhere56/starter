summary: "A first report from the SAVE prospective, multicentre, single-blinded randomised controlled trial of the Selution sustained limus release (SLR; Cordis) drug-eluting balloon (DEB) in patients with failing arteriovenous fistula (AVF) undergoing haemodialysis has demonstrated “significantly higher efficacy” compared with plain balloon angioplasty, with a higher target lesion primary patency (TLPP) at six-month follow-up.
