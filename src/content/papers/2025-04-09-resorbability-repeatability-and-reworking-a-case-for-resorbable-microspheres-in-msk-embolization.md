## L’essentiel

Resorbable microspheres are making waves in musculoskeletal (MSK) embolization, challenging the use of permanent embolics. As clinical evidence supporting their safety and efficacy accelerates, these agents could reshape treatment strategies— offering effective pain relief while reducing long-term risks.
