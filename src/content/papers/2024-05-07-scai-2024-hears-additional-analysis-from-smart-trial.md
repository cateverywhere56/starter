publishedDate: "7 mai 2024"
summary: "Additional analysis from the SMART trial has demonstrated clinical non-inferiority of self-expanding valves versus balloon-expandable valves in aortic stenosis patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and confirmed valve performance superiority over time based on haemodynamics. Data also showed similar positive results in two age groups (&#60; or ≥80 years old)."

## L’essentiel

Additional analysis from the SMART trial has demonstrated clinical non-inferiority of self-expanding valves versus balloon-expandable valves in aortic stenosis patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and confirmed valve performance superiority over time based on haemodynamics. Data also showed similar positive results in two age groups (&#60; or ≥80 years old).
