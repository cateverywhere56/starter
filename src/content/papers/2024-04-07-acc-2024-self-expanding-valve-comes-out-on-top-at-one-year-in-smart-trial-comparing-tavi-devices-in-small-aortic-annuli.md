summary: "Results of the SMART trial, comparing the use of two widely deployed transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) systems in patients with small aortic annuli, has found that the use of a supra-annular self-expanding valve resulted in similar clinical outcomes and superior valve performance at one year compared with a balloon-expandable valve.
