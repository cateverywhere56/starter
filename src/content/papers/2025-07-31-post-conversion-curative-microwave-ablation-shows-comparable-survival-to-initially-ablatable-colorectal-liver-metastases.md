## L’essentiel

Initially unablatable patients with synchronous colorectal liver metastases (sCRLM) who successfully converted to ablatable status and underwent curative-intent microwave ablation (c-MWA) achieve comparable intrahepatic progression-free survival (ihPFS) and overall survival (OS) to initially ablatable cases undergoing radical MWA (r-MWA).
