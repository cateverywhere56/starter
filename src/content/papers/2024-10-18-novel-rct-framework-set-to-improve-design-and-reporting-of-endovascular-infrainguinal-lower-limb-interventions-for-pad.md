title: "Novel RCT framework set to improve design and reporting of endovascular infrainguinal lower-limb interventions for PAD"

publishedDate: "18 octobre 2024"
summary: "Pilot testing has shown that a new framework—dubbed Endo-STAR—can be used to describe and standardise endovascular interventions for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) within a randomised controlled trial (RCT) protocol and monitor adherence to the protocol over the course of a trial. Ewa M Zywicka (University of Bristol Medical School, Bristol, UK) shared this conclusion during [&#8230;] The post Novel RCT framework set to improve design and reporting of endovascular infrainguinal lower-limb interventions for PAD appeared first on Vascular News ."

## L’essentiel

Pilot testing has shown that a new framework—dubbed Endo-STAR—can be used to describe and standardise endovascular interventions for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) within a randomised controlled trial (RCT) protocol and monitor adherence to the protocol over the course of a trial. Ewa M Zywicka (University of Bristol Medical School, Bristol, UK) shared this conclusion during [&#8230;] The post Novel RCT framework set to improve design and reporting of endovascular infrainguinal lower-limb interventions for PAD appeared first on Vascular News .
