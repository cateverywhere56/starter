## L’essentiel

Findings from the COVER-ALL trial suggest that software-based assessment of the minimal ablative margin during percutaneous thermal ablation significantly improves treatment precision and may reduce local tumour progression in liver cancer patients. Published in The Lancet Gastroenterology &#38; Hepatology, the randomised phase 2 trial represents the first prospective evaluation of a software-driven margin confirmation method, [&#8230;] The post COVER-ALL trial highlights superiority of software-based assessment for liver tumour ablation margins appeared first on Interventional News .
