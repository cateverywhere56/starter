## L’essentiel

The first-in-man use of the ventriculo-coronary transcatheter outward navigation and reentry—VECTOR—technique, a closed-chest, transcatheter, coronary ostial bypass procedure, has been reported in Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions. Adam Greenbaum (Emory School of Medicine, Atlanta, USA) and colleagues from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) detail the case involving a 67-year-old male patient treated for bioprosthetic aortic [&#8230;] The post First-in-man VECTOR procedure offers new approach for preventing coronary obstruction appeared first on Cardiovascular News .
