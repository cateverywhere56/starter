summary: "Four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC)—a shelf-stable medication containing freeze-dried clotting factors—has been shown to be significantly more effective in addressing severe bleeding during cardiac surgery compared to the current standard of care, frozen plasma. This is the headline finding from FARES-II, a phase 3, randomised, active-control study, comparing the two approaches in adult cardiac surgery [&#8230;] The post Trial results open door to frozen plasma alternative for bleeding management in cardiac surgery appeared first on Cardiovascular News ."
