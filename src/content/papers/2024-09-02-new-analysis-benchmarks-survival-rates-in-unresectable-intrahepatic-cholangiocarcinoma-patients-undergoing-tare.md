title: "New analysis benchmarks survival rates in unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients undergoing TARE"

publishedDate: "2 septembre 2024"
summary: "Updating on a previous meta-analysis, new data which pooled survival estimates of patients undergoing transarterial radioembolization (TARE) has shown the treatment to be a valid option for unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICCA), particularly if the patient is naïve to previous treatments. These results were recently published in the journal Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (CVIR)."

## L’essentiel

Updating on a previous meta-analysis, new data which pooled survival estimates of patients undergoing transarterial radioembolization (TARE) has shown the treatment to be a valid option for unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICCA), particularly if the patient is naïve to previous treatments. These results were recently published in the journal Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (CVIR).
