summary: "Musculoskeletal (MSK) embolization—including techniques such as transarterial microembolization (TAME) and genicular artery embolization (GAE)—has emerged as a novel, minimally invasive treatment for chronic joint and tendon pain. Initially applied to conditions such as knee osteoarthritis (OA), frozen shoulder, and tendinopathies, these procedures target hypervascular inflammation, a key contributor to chronic MSK symptoms."

## L’essentiel

Musculoskeletal (MSK) embolization—including techniques such as transarterial microembolization (TAME) and genicular artery embolization (GAE)—has emerged as a novel, minimally invasive treatment for chronic joint and tendon pain. Initially applied to conditions such as knee osteoarthritis (OA), frozen shoulder, and tendinopathies, these procedures target hypervascular inflammation, a key contributor to chronic MSK symptoms.
