title: "AI-derived risk score may improve planning of TEER for secondary mitral regurgitation"

publishedDate: "24 novembre 2023"
summary: "A novel risk score derived from artificial intelligence (AI) may be more effective than currently used models at predicting one-year survival prognosis and identifying individuals at extreme risk of mortality or lack of clinical improvement among patients with secondary mitral regurgitation (SMR) undergoing transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER). Lukas Stolz (Klinikum der Universität München, Munich, Germany) [&#8230;] The post AI-derived risk score may improve planning of TEER for secondary mitral regurgitation appeared first on Cardiovascular News ."
