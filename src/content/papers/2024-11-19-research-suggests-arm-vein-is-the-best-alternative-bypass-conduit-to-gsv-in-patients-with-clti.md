title: "Research suggests arm vein is the best alternative bypass conduit to GSV in patients with CLTI"
date: "2024-11-19T23:50:39.000Z"
publishedDate: "19 novembre 2024"
summary: "A new analysis has found arm veins to be the most suitable alternative conduits to great saphenous veins (GSV) in chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI) patients, particularly in below-knee bypass targets. Prosthetic grafts also represent an adequate option, the researchers add, whilst advising that the use of biological grafts in this setting should be limited."
