summary: "Mechanical thrombectomy by means of computer-assisted vacuum thrombectomy (CAVT) using the 16Fr Lightning Flash system (Penumbra) along with anticoagulation for acute-to-intermediate pulmonary embolism (PE) demonstrated functional assessment improvements, earlier physiological recovery and greater reduction in pulmonary artery obstruction when compared to anticoagulation alone. These were among the latest findings from the STORM-PE randomized controlled trial [&#8230;] The post CAVT with anticoagulation significantly improves functional outcomes in PE patients, RCT shows appeared first on Vascular News ."
