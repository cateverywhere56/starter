## L’essentiel

Data from a new study have found that venous leak embolization yields additional clinical improvement and treatment potential in patients with vasculogenic erectile dysfunction (ED) resistant to phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitors (PDE5i) due to mixed arterio-venous disease. These findings were recently published in the journal CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology (CVIR).
