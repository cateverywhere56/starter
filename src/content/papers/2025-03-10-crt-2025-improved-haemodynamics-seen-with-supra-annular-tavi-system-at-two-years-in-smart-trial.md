summary: "Two-year results of the SMART trial, comparing two commonly used transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) systems for the treatment of aortic stenosis in patients with small aortic annuli, have shown that though the use of a supra-annular valve demonstrated an improvement on haemodynamic performance measures compared to a self-expanding platform, rates of mortality, disabling stroke [&#8230;] The post CRT 2025: Improved haemodynamics seen with supra-annular TAVI system at two years in SMART trial appeared first on Cardiovascular News ."

## L’essentiel

Two-year results of the SMART trial, comparing two commonly used transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) systems for the treatment of aortic stenosis in patients with small aortic annuli, have shown that though the use of a supra-annular valve demonstrated an improvement on haemodynamic performance measures compared to a self-expanding platform, rates of mortality, disabling stroke [&#8230;] The post CRT 2025: Improved haemodynamics seen with supra-annular TAVI system at two years in SMART trial appeared first on Cardiovascular News .
